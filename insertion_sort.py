#Insertion sort is both faster and well-arguably more simplistic than both bubble sort and selection sort.
# Funny enough, itâ€™s how many people sort their cards when playing a card game! On each loop iteration, insertion
# sort removes one element from the array. It then finds the location where that element belongs within another
# sorted array and inserts it there. It repeats this process until no input elements remain.

#best case is big of n
# worst case is big of n^2
