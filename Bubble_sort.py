#. Bubble sort steps through the list and compares adjacent pairs of elements. The elements are swapped if they are in the
# wrong order. The pass through the unsorted portion of the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
# Because Bubble sort repeatedly passes through the unsorted part of the list, it has a worst case complexity of O(nÂ²).
